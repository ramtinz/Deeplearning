| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Image classification, object detection | Good at learning spatial hierarchies, efficient at processing images due to their use of convolutional layers | Can be difficult to train and may require a lot of data | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras             |
| Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) | Natural language processing, time series analysis | Can handle sequential data, good at learning patterns over time | Can be difficult to train and may have difficulty learning long-term dependencies | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras             |
| Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) | Image generation, style transfer | Can generate high-quality images, can learn to perform tasks by competing with another model | Can be difficult to train and may require a lot of data | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras             |
| Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) | Natural language processing, time series analysis | Can handle sequential data and learn long-term dependencies | Can be difficult to train and may require a lot of data | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras             |
| Autoencoder | Dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection | Can learn to compress data and reconstruct it accurately | May require a lot of data to learn effectively | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras             |
